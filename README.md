## 3D Voxel Game Engine
Mitochondrion Engine is a 3D game engine for windows that specializes in voxel rendering. However it has plenty of ofther features to supplement the creation of a voxel game. Thanks to the voxel tools that it will provide, users don't need to spend time figuring out how to build optimal meshes for voxels or how minimize draw calls. Everything is ready and optimized. In just a few simple steps, you can have a vast world made up of cubes that is ready for anyone to explore!
